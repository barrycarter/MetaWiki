I ran "ocrad" (an optical character recognition (OCR)) program on all
the Pearls Before Swine strips I could find online. The results are in
this directory.

Since Stephan Pastis uses a "handwriting font" (or actually hand
writes the strips?), the results are very poor, but still potentially
interesting for research purposes.
