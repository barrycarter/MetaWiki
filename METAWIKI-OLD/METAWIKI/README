Creates a semantic mediawiki from pbs.txt

referata.com settings (most left at default):

Main/Allow External Images
Privacy/Editing/Very Closed [since all data comes from pbs.txt]

TODO: consider doing all parsing locally and sending results to
regular non-semantic mediawiki (or something)

TO RUN: bc-pbs3.pl (seems to do it all?)

and then run "mirror-referata" alias
