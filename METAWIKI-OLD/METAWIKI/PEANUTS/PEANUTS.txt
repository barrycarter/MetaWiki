NOTES:

 - the index pages of the book reprints also have character listings
 on a per-page (not per-strip) basis. Can I use these to be more efficient

 - Lucy/Linus (for example) are canonical names, but full name are
 Lucy Van Pelt, Linus Van Pelt, for example

 - http://www.yourdictionary.com/tattletale-gray explains tattletale gray pun

 - the pipe for alternate text feature appears to be broken
