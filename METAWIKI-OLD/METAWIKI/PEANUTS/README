An attempt to create a Peanuts wiki using the metawiki format.

TODO: gocomics has two sets of repeat Peanuts strips:

http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/ which has all original strips +
colorized versions of many

and

http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts-begins/ which started on 5 Jan 2015,
and prints ONLY colorized versions of the older strips

Currently, I'm using /peanuts/ for the strips through the end of 2014
(including colorized strips) and /peanuts-begins/ starting 5 Jan 2015,
with no strips at all for the first 4 days of 2015.

I need to rectify this and use both series for colorized strips.
